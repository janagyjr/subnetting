How To Use This File

This document illustrates the easiest way to figure out your subnets that I've yet seen. 

IP Address
First, you need to convert your ip address into binary.

Subnet Mask
Next, you'll take /# (where # is a number from 1-32) and determine your subnet mask. The way you do this is you have as many 1s (from left to right) as the number indicates. In this example we have a /19 subnet, therefore the first 19 digits (left-to-right) are 1s, then convert to decimal for the subnet mask.

Network ID
To get your network ID, line up your binary IP address and subnet mask, and any column that has a one in it becomes a 1 in your network ID, everything else is a zero. Convert to decimal for the human-readable ip address. The bits you're converting to 1s are known as 'host bits' and are the parts of the address that correlate directly to usable addresses by hosts.

First Host
Your first host is the first IP address after the network ID (see the example problem below).

Broadcast
Your broadcast address is related to your subnet mask. Whatever columns had zero in them in your subnet mask are converted to 1s for your broadcast address. Your broadcast address is going to be in your network block so it will look similar to what is in the example below.

Last Host
Your last host is the IP address just before the broadcast address. 

Example Problem:
IP 31.203.5.236/19
00011111.11001011.00000101.11101100 IP		31.203.5.236
11111111.11111111.11100000.00000000 subnet	255.255.224.0
00011111.11001011.00000000.00000000 network id	31.203.0.0
00011111.11001011.00000000.00000001 First host	31.203.0.1
00011111.11001011.00011111.11111110 Last Host	31.203.31.254
00011111.11001011.00011111.11111111 Broadcast	31.203.31.255

Example:
178.205.3.157/17
10110010.11001101.00000011.00101110 IP		178.205.3.157
11111111.11111111.10000000.00000000 subnet	255.255.128.0
10110010.11001101.00000000.00000000 network id	178.205.0.0
10110010.11001101.00000000.00000001 first host	178.205.0.1
10110010.11001101.01111111.11111110 last host	178.205.127.254
10110010.11001101.01111111.11111111 broadcast	178.205.127.255
